# ENVIRONMENT SETUP ERRORS you can and probably will encounter

---

1. <strong>ReferenceError: \_\_dirname is not defined in ES module scope</strong><BR>
   This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and 'C:\personal-projects-folder\do-shit-CRUD-app\package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
   at file:///C:/personal-projects-folder/do-shit-CRUD-app/webpack.config.js:7:18

    <strong>SOLUTION:</strong> https://www.kindacode.com/article/node-js-using-__dirname-and-__filename-with-es-modules/

2. <strong>ReferenceError: module is not defined in ES module scope</strong><BR>
   This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and 'C:\personal-projects-folder\do-shit-CRUD-app\package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.<br>
   This error reffered to <em><strong>webpack.config.js</strong></em>

    <strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Remove "type": "module" from package.json. But it returns a new error:<br><br>
    =====> 3. import path from "path";

    <strong>SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module</strong>

    <strong>SOLUTION: </strong> If returning "type": "module" to package.json, ERROR assigned under point 2 occurs again.

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273824/typescript-cannot-use-import-statement-outside-a-module/60225870#60225870

    IMPORTANT: Use ESM syntax, for importing and exporting files! Add "type": "module" to package.json.
    https://gist.github.com/johnrichardrinehart/c8ec6ab1e60f39fc3b8dc738db649ec0 - some dev server properties are not supported anymore. NOTE!

3. <strong>eslint --init</strong> <br>
   eslint : The term 'eslint' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or  
   operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is  
   correct and try again.
   At line:1 char:1

-   eslint --init
-   ```
      + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (eslint:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
      + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
    ```

<strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Follow guide on official site https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started

eslint-loader depricated https://laurieontech.com/posts/eslint-webpack-plugin/ USE `eslint-webpack-plugin`.

# WHAT I LEARNED - 2022 edition (march)

---

NOTE: All dependancies NOT CRUCIAL for production- not to be included in production bundle- are saved with --save-dev or -D option.

1. <strong>STEP ONE: SET WEBPACK</strong><br>
   Setting webpack is not that difficult. You need to install `npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`.
   This will install webpack and webpack interface to work with webpack via terminal.

2. <strong>STEP TWO: Choose your stack</strong><br>
   If you'll work with React, install 'npm i react react-dom --save-dev' first. Choose your linter and traspiler. I chose BABEL and ESLINT. I am also using PRETTIER to format my code on save.
   Install all three via `npm i --save-dev babel-loader eslint prettier`

BABEL needs additional plugins:  
 `"@babel/core": "^7.17.5", "@babel/preset-env": "^7.16.11", "@babel/preset-react": "^7.16.7",`

to work with webpack. You also need to install:
`"sass-loader": "^12.6.0", "style-loader": "^3.3.1", "css-loader": "^6.7.1",`

These loaders will ensure that CSS modules are recognized. If you're using CSS (vanilla, DO NOT INSTALL SASS-LOADER) or SASS (install SASS-LOADER) you need to install them.

3. <strong>STEP THREE: WHAT the f\*\*\* is LOADER</strong><br>
   Well simply put webpack uses loaders to recognize file types. This is important because without loaders webpack won't know how to bundle your code. ERRORS GALORE.

4. <strong>STEP FOUR: install file-loader</strong><br>
   You'll need it to preocess font files (or any file for that matter) - if they're custom.

5. <strong>STEP FIVE: HELLS LOSE WITH configuration files!</strong><br>
   So the most challenging part is to make it all work together. To make all of your dependencies friends with webpack you need to create `webpack.config.js` file in root of your document.

You can create `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc`, `babel.config.json` files as well, also in root folder.
For now leave them empty, besides babel.

<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Add this line to babel.config.json as stated in their official web page:
https://babeljs.io/setup#installation

<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>For prettier and eslint to play nice with each other check: https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html

Configuration for webpack with all of these dependecies - MINUS ESLINT AND PRETTIER - check `webpack.config.js` file.
DISCLAIMER: I also added `webpack-dev-server` for live server and `cssMini` plugin for minifiying CSS files into one.

6.<strong> STEP SIX: ESLINT ERROR GALORE</strong><br>
First add this lines to prettierc.json file:
{
"trailingComma": "es5",
"tabWidth": 4,
"semi": false,
"singleQuote": true
}

NOTE: This is a very basic configuration for prettier.

Then install eslint and eslint-webpack-plugin. Run command `npx @eslint/config`. This will bring up a set of questions about your preffered styles. But BEWARE. GET READY FOR ERROR GALORE.

```

Well, what now?

To solve this we can try a few things. Installing a plugin that may help us fix prettier/eslint problems.<br><br> 1.<strong>SOLUTION 1:</strong> <br>Install `npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier`.
Then add this line in .eslintrc.json under extends: ` "extends": ["plugin:react/recommended", "airbnb", "prettier"],`

DID IT WORK: Well yes and no. We did get right of most errors but 12 of them persist.

So we can cleary see that most of this errors are connected to eslint rules. Once this is clear we can (in our terminal console - VSCode) check the documentation foe each of the errors. In some cases we only need to add a certain rule inside .eslintrc.json file and problems are solved.

<strong>DO NOTE:</strong><br>
Check the documentation for rules, read them and implement them. Experiment. Define the rules to be fit to your needs.

SOLVED!
